.texte{ 
    color: black;
}

I'd like the textarea here to only be at the value of the color (where "black" is). So that the user can try and change the color. 

When he does, I'd like to automatically update the css so that when the user inputs "red", then the text displayed should be in red color. So the only editable part by the user here the color value
